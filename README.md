# Match Game

Written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for styling

This project uses a barebones HTML file and relies on the JS file for HTML file manipulation.

The game allows users to select the amount of tiles they want to match and then displays those tiles on screen. The user then makes match attempts until all tiles are matched.

The game can be found [here.](https://icarus.cs.weber.edu/~jr41325/CS2350/Match_Game/matchGame.html)
